The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.
On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS
Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough
lifeboats for everyone on board, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers
and crew. While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some
groups of people were more likely to survive than others.

Insights:
We will be answering two questions regarding the dataset:
1. Is there a significant difference in the mean sex between the passenger who
survived and the passenger who did not survive?.
2. Is there a substantial difference in the survival rate between the male and female
passengers?
